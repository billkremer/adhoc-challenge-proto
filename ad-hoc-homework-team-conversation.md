Me:  hi, I've been working on the Proto homework and noticed that the .dat file seems to have 72 records although it says it only has 71 records.

Me:  I noticed that the first record (record 0) is similar to the example in the instructions. Is it an actual record? or just an example?

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  it is an actual recored

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  we provided the first record as an example to help folks know if they're decoding it properly

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  with respect to the number of records, the header contains the canonical information about how the records should be processed.

Me:  I don't understand. if I look at the number of records provided in the file, it seems like I see 72 records (0 - 71) and the number of records provided is 71, not 72. or am I missing something?

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  yes, the header is correct on the number of records

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  if the file contains other data, they may be corruption or something else

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  the header will always tell you the number of records to process

Me:  ok, that is very odd. I will assume that the last record is incorrect and reflect that in the comments. Thanks

Ad Hoc Homework Team:  Thanks for taking the time to work on it!
